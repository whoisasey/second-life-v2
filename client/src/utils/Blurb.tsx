			<h2>Welcome to Second Life!</h2>
			<h4>
				You're probably here because you've been shared a link or randomly got
				here through my GitHub.
			</h4>
			<h4>
				This project is <strong>under construction</strong>, so here is a
				rundown of what I have planned:
			</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<Link to="/charities/submit">Submit A Charity</Link>
					<p>
						this will eventually be a page where the Charity has to create a
						profile before submitting a charity on their own behalf
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					{/* <Link to="/charities/submit"> */}
					Create/View a Charity Profile
					{/* </Link> */}
					<p>
						Charities will be able to make an account and maintain their info
						that will be displayed on the site
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					{/* <Link to="/charities/submit"> */}
					Create/View a User Profile
					{/* </Link> */}
					<p>
						Non-charity users will be able to make an account and keep track of
						charities they like
					</p>
				</li>
				{/* <li> */}
				{/* <Link to="/charities/submit"> */}
				{/* Create a Charity Profile */}
				{/* </Link> */}
				{/* </li>
						<li></li> */}
			</ul>
			<em>What makes this site different than other competitors?</em>
			<p>
				Second Life is built for the millennial (clich√©, I know!) I want to
				create a space that is well-designed and easy for millennials to
				navigate and still feel attached to, without the corporate feel.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<p>Second Life is not:</p>
				<li>A place where donations are made directly on the site</li>
				<li>Sponsored by any organization</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
